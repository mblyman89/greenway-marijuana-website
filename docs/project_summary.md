# Greenway Marijuana Website Development Project Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on the Greenway Marijuana website development project, including completed tasks, current status, and next steps. The project aims to create a modern, user-friendly website for Greenway Marijuana, a retail cannabis store in Port Orchard, Washington, with integration to Leafly, Weedmaps, and CultiveraPOS.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Identified best practices for cannabis retail websites
- ✅ Researched age verification requirements and implementations for cannabis websites

### Planning Phase
- ✅ Defined comprehensive website structure and created detailed sitemap
- ✅ Planned integration points with Leafly, Weedmaps, and CultiveraPOS
- ✅ Designed user flow from age verification to checkout
- ✅ Developed content strategy for blog, newsletter, and other content sections

## Current Status
The project is currently in the design phase. We have completed the wireframes for the main user flow pages and created a comprehensive style guide. The wireframes demonstrate the user experience from entering the site through the age verification gateway, browsing products, adding items to cart, checking out, and viewing order confirmation. We've also designed the loyalty program page to showcase the membership benefits and tiers.

## Key Features Designed

### Age Verification Gateway
- Full-screen overlay requiring age verification before accessing site content
- Clear yes/no options with legal disclaimers
- Remember me functionality for returning visitors

### Product Browsing Experience
- Intuitive category navigation
- Advanced filtering options (strain type, THC content, price, etc.)
- Detailed product cards with key information
- Comprehensive product detail pages with:
  - Multiple product images
  - Detailed descriptions
  - Lab results
  - Effects and flavors
  - Customer reviews

### Shopping Experience
- User-friendly shopping cart
- Streamlined checkout process
- Order confirmation with clear pickup instructions
- ID verification reminders

### Loyalty Program
- Tiered membership system (Green, Gold, Platinum)
- Point-based rewards
- Member registration and login
- Clear explanation of benefits and how to earn points

## Integration Planning
We've researched and documented the integration requirements for:

1. **Leafly Integration**
   - Menu API for product synchronization
   - Enhanced product information
   - Brand catalog integration

2. **Weedmaps Integration**
   - Menu API for inventory synchronization
   - Orders API for online ordering
   - Real-time inventory updates

3. **CultiveraPOS Integration**
   - Inventory management
   - Order processing
   - Customer management

## Next Steps

### Design Phase Completion
1. Create wireframes for remaining pages:
   - Blog/content pages
   - About/contact pages
2. Design responsive versions for mobile and tablet devices
3. Finalize logo selection from provided variations

### Development Phase Preparation
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement age verification gateway
3. Develop core website structure and navigation
4. Begin integration with Leafly, Weedmaps, and CultiveraPOS

## Technical Approach
The website will be built using:
- Next.js for the frontend framework
- React for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Node.js for backend functionality
- PostgreSQL for database
- Vercel for hosting and deployment

## Timeline
- **Design Phase**: Estimated completion in 1-2 weeks
- **Development Phase**: Estimated to take 4-6 weeks
- **Testing Phase**: Estimated to take 1-2 weeks
- **Deployment Phase**: Estimated to take 1 week
- **Total Project Timeline**: 7-11 weeks

## Recommendations
1. **Logo Selection**: Finalize the logo variation to be used throughout the website. Based on the provided options, we recommend the Black & Green variation with mountain imagery as it provides good contrast and aligns with the cannabis industry's common color palette.

2. **Mobile-First Approach**: While we've designed desktop wireframes first for visualization purposes, we recommend implementing with a mobile-first approach during development as many users will access the site via mobile devices.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading for product images and optimize asset delivery to ensure fast page loads, especially on mobile networks.

4. **Compliance Considerations**: Ensure all content and functionality complies with Washington state cannabis regulations, particularly regarding advertising restrictions and age verification requirements.

5. **Analytics Implementation**: Set up comprehensive analytics to track user behavior, conversion rates, and loyalty program engagement to inform future optimizations.

## Conclusion
The Greenway Marijuana website project has made significant progress through the research and planning phases and is well into the design phase. The wireframes and style guide provide a solid foundation for the development team to begin implementation. The next steps involve completing the remaining design tasks and transitioning to the development phase.
